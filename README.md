## Airline Management System

The Airline Management System project automates the registration process of an airline system. It provides comprehensive information such as passenger details, flight information, and a list of all passengers. The system facilitates data storage and retrieval related to the airline industry and manages transactions related to air travel. It also allows adding records when a passenger reserves a ticket. The system uses a MySQL database for data storage and retrieval, enabling the addition of any number of records. The project manages various objects including Airlines, Airline Employees, and Customers/Travellers, each accessing a corresponding database schema with relevant tables.
